# singlecamera_orbslam2
Ros package of RaulMur's ORBSLAM2 (https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)

This branch uses the map saving/loading feature created by Alkaid-Benetnash's ORBSLAM2 https://github.com/Alkaid-Benetnash/ORB_SLAM2
This branch also uses the YOLOv3 from https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros to remove features in the area where objects (e.g. humans) are detected.
